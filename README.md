# hello-world

This is my introductory project into the Git world, the classic "Hello world!" routine.

With this, it is my objective to learn the basics of GitHub, version keeping, branching, etc.

My overall objective with interacting with GitHub is to get acquainted with systems that are generally used in the field of Data Science, a field that I am trying to get into professionally.
